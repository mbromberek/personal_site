Bootlegs are unauthorized merchandise created to fool the end buyer that they’re purchasing an authorized piece of merchandise approved by the creator or the company the creator works with to license merchandise.  Learn how to identify bootlegs, how bootlegs nearly killed the anime industry, how bootlegs hurt the creators who work so hard on their creations, and what you can do to help protect what we all love. \nThe panel lasts about 30-40 minutes, after which attendees can bring any piece of merchandise and the experts at Fast Food Anime and Tangerine Mountain will evaluate it to tell you if it is legit.  Collectible cards, plush, books, video games, DVDs, CDs, posters, wall scrolls, figures, clothing, and more are all able to be evaluated.  (To ensure everyone has a turn, if you have a large collection, please talk to the presenters about setting up an appointment.) Fast Food Anime owner John Santellano is a 20-year veteran of the foreign and domestic video game sales industry, providing authentic video games, consoles, and anime merchandise to convention attendees and wholesale buyers throughout the country.  His experiences in Japan have enhanced his knowledge of the broad range of authentic Japanese goods and how to identify them.  Tangerine Mountain owners Cheri Santellano and Teri Noto have been educated about intellectual property at their father’s knee since they were little kids.  Their father, Arthur Fakes, is an intellectual property and commercial negotiations expert, specializing in international and domestic copyright, trademark, trade secret, and commercial interests, with a particular focus on Japan and East Asia for the past 50 years.",
